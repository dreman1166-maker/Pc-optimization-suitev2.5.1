# PC Optimization Suite v2.5.1 - Update Summary

**Release Date:** September 21, 2025 at 06:50:15 GMT
**Update Type:** Hotfix Release

## 🚀 What's New in v2.5.1

### Critical Time Display Fixes
- **FIXED:** Time display cutoff at top of panel - adjusted positioning from Y:15 to Y:12
- **FIXED:** Overlap with computer name text - reduced panel height from 85px to 75px
- **ENHANCED:** Made time panel background fully transparent for seamless integration
- **IMPROVED:** Optimized label spacing within 75px height constraint
- **REFINED:** System information truncation (35 → 25 chars) to prevent layout conflicts

### Technical Changes Made
1. **Time Panel Transparency**: Added `$timePanel.BackColor = [System.Drawing.Color]::Transparent`
2. **Panel Size Optimization**: Reduced height from 85px to 75px to prevent overlap
3. **Positioning Refinements**: 
   - Time label: Y:15→12, Height:30→28
   - Date label: Y:42→36, Height:18→16  
   - Full date label: Y:62→54, Height:20→18
4. **Layout Improvements**: Reduced system info width from `($overviewWidth - 20)` to `($overviewWidth - 200)`
5. **Version Bump**: Updated from v2.5.0 to v2.5.1
